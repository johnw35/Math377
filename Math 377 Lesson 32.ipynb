Instead of looking at the ratio $\\Lambda$ itself, we often consider $-2\\log \\Lambda$ instead, since it has a handy distribution. \n",

Recall that the maximum likelihood estimate of $\\lambda$ is $1\\over\\bar{X}$. We collect a random sample of size 20 and want to test the hypothesis $H_0: \\lambda = 3$ vs $H_1: \\lambda \\neq 3$.
