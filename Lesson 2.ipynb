    "Question 7: An observational study is one where the scientist does not set up an experiment, but looks for trends in data that has already been gathered. An experiment is a study where all variables except for one is controlled by the scientist who is looking for what that variable causes. Observational studies are used when an experiment would be unethical or unfeasible. Data science will likely use observational studies more, because we can study data from millions of people whereas setting up an experiment involving millions of people would be too expensive."
